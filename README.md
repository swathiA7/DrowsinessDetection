# Drowsiness Detection System

This project is designed to detect drowsiness in individuals using real-time image processing and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes facial features and eye movements to identify signs of fatigue and alertness, potentially helping prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving or similar scenarios.

## Features
- Real-time detection of drowsiness through webcam input.
- Utilizes facial landmarks to monitor eye blink rate and duration.
- Provides alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.
- Easy-to-use interface for deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Dlib, Imutils, Numpy
- **Framework**: Machine learning techniques for feature extraction and prediction
